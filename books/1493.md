summary: "Eight decades after Columbus, a Spaniard named Legazpi succeeded where Columbus had failed. He sailed west to establish continuous trade with China, then the richest and most powerful country in the world. In Manila, a city founded by Legazpi, silver from America mined by African and Indian slaves was sold to Asians in exchange for silk for Europeans. It was the first time goods and people from all corners of the world were connected in a single global exchange. Just as Columbus biologically created a new world, Legazpi and the Spanish empire he served economically created a new world. In this story, Mann uncovers the roots of today's fiercest political disputes, from immigration to trade policy and cultural wars. In 1493, Mann once again offers readers a groundbreaking scientific interpretation of our past, unmatched in its authority and fascination."
