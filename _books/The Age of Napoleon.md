summary: "This third munificent Horizon book which represents a great deal of work by a great many people is, quite frankly, an idea-project-production job with a mass market gift book designation. There are 330 pictures, 117 in full color, some double spreads, and the color is not subtle. Throughout there are insets on special features of the period, its intellectual cadre, its fashions, arts, society, Napoleon's family, his loves, his son, and ultimately extending to vistas of other parts of the world -- England, America, Russia, etc. The main narrative, the parabola of the rise of Le Petit Caporal to Emperor, to his expensive defeat and downfall, has been written by that master of this age-J. Christopher Herold. One follows the little \"\"Corsican savage\"\" from his early years to the tyrant's progress on the road to \"\"la gloire\"\". And his legacy, spread eagled across the centuries, is evaluated in terms of real contributions (Code Napoleon, etc.) and apocryphal associations."
