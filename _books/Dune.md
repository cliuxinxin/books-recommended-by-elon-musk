title: "Dune"
author: "Frank Herbert"
year: 1965
quote: "love Dune, but Frank Herbert – a genius writer – was obviously tripping balls writing that book. Can’t expect total coherence in a situation like that 😂 My guess is that he was high af lying on the lawn one day and saw an earthworm and thought “what if it was REALLY BIG”."
