year: 1965
quote: "love Dune, but Frank Herbert – a genius writer – was obviously tripping balls writing that book. Can’t expect total coherence in a situation like that 😂 My guess is that he was high af lying on the lawn one day and saw an earthworm and thought “what if it was REALLY BIG”."

summary: "A dune is a landform composed of wind- or water-driven sand. It typically takes the form of a mound, ridge, or hill. An area with dunes is called a dune system or a dune complex. A large dune complex is called a dune field, while broad, flat regions covered with wind-swept sand or dunes, with little or no vegetation, are called ergs or sand seas. Dunes occur in different shapes and sizes, but most kinds of dunes are longer on the stoss (upflow) side, where the sand is pushed up the dune, and have a shorter slip face in the lee side. The valley or trough between dunes is called a dune slack."
